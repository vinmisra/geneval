Simple illustration of multi-subject finetuning in SD and evaluation via trained models. See [blog post]()

Installation: 
- you'll need to be able to run SD itself, and enough GPU memory to perform SD finetuning. 
- Some dependencies are potentially not captured by `requirements.txt`. For the rest, `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- to build/install the underlying module, `pip install -e .` from the repository directory.

Actual experiments / data from the blog post are not posted here for privacy reasons, but I've included three notebooks demonstrating manual scoring, evaluator model training, and evaluator model based scoring.
